# Using_Python
This project involves parsing a log file and using the data to give information. We used if and for loops to find the answers needed for marketing. 

In the code we use to retrieve the log from the server we use the requests module. 
If the machine you are using does not have this module already, it can easily be downloaded by using the following command in any terminal:
python -m pip install requests

If any error occurs it is most likely in syntax, check the syntax and try again if you recieve an error.
